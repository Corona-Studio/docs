## Run LauncherX to launching Minecraft

Basically, the prerequisites are basically the same for all desktop environments.

Downloading the **Configuration Assistant** is the most suitable solution for ordinary users (the tool has not yet developed, so stay tuned XD.); and for the distribution environment, it is recommended to use the **stable version including runtime** (will be released in "Stable Released" when the first stable version comes out); in addition, you can manually place the LauncherX executable file you want to use directly into your directory after completing the local runtime installation. This is exactly what the Configuration Assistant automates.

But for now, whether it is Windows, macOS or a Linux distribution with a desktop environment, or whether the architecture is x86-64, x86-S, amd64 or ARM64, you have downloaded the corresponding LauncherX according to the current operating system to your desired location. The folder in which it is run, and <a target="_blank" href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/zh-cn/download/dotnet/7.0">has prepared the runtime environment accordingly</a> (the configuration assistant will be completed automatically, and this step is not required when including the run), then you can double-click its icon to run it like other apps.

Next, I will list all known possible issues.

## Common issues

Since our Java RE detection mechanism works in "search-execution" mode to confirm whether the runtime is available, you may encounter an error pop-up window from Java when you start LauncherX. You can turn it off directly, as this will not affect LauncherX runs. You can **remove** the damaged runtime.
